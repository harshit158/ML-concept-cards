**Design Pattern 1: Useful Overfitting**

Overfitting is useful when:  
1. There is no noise -> Labels are accurate for all instances 
2. Entire input space can be tabulated (you have all the possible examples)
3. Knowledge Distillation from Larger ML model into smaller ML model

Points:  
1. The best fitting model is a "large" model that has been properly "regularized"
